				<p>I'm a UX/UI designer and web developer in Denver, CO. Iâ€™ve been working in the design space since May 2013. I started as a Digital Retoucher, discovered Interaction Design designing touch screens, studied Front End Development, and now I am responsible for the success of many products and applications. I enjoy learning from others big and small. Currently, I am studying fly fishing, cooking techniques/spices, neuroscience, and training for my next outdoor adventure.</p>

						<p>Lead UX/UI Designer working with multifunctional team members. Helped lead and guide team to meet deliverables and increase communication. Established best practices, better workflows, and addressed pain points.</p> 
                    
                        <p>Our objectives for this project were to capture MVP for the application's vision and requirements, reorganize and revisit how we work together as a team, strategize user research and missing components, and align timelines with expectations. I led the discussion with the development team on how to work together and best practices for communication between teams. I was able to prioritize their needs, misunderstandings, set up better communication channels, and future expectations. We also identified potential future pain points and how we should work together and address them as a team.</p>

						<p>UX/UI Designer and Researcher working with other designers to build a website that will create a more transparent view into the funding of the recovery of Puerto Rico after the impact of hurricanes Irma and Maria.</p>
                   
                        <p>My best work to date is helping with the Puerto Rico transparency project. I didn't play a lead role on the project. My teammates asked me to help with the data. I'm really good at looking at numbers, data, and things that are difficult to understand. I helped create an infographic that clearly described how money was coming in and where it was being distributed. This has helped the government and the people of Puerto Rico trust each other more. Being able to help others including my team is what makes me love this job.</p>

						<p>I taught myself how to be a UX/UI designer when I started working at Shane Co. as their Interactive Content Specialist in October 2013. I launched over 164 displays nationwide in under 3 years. This job inspired me to go back to school and really learn the principals of Interactive design. One of the projects I did there that I am most proud of is the interactive kiosk that was installed January 2017. I started the project in July of 2016.</p>
