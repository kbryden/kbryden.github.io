						<h2>The Problem</h2>
						<p>The Interactive Kiosk was created to solve a major problem that Shane Co. was having especially with the advancement of technology. They needed to replace old outdated Shaneco.com stations that looked junky in the stores. They also needed to find a way to help men search for an engagement ring. The problem was that men were coming in and telling sales associates about a ring she wanted on social media. Then he would proceed to search on his phone for the image. This was distracting for the customer and the sales associate. They needed a solution that would enhance the interaction between the two while still being helpful.
						<h2>The Solution</h2>
						<p>The solution was to present them with a kiosk so that they could browse and compare social media along with Shane Co.’s online catalog. Now they can not only see all social posts but they can also see the company’s history and values. They are presented with not only a way to find what she really wants but also a reason to buy from Shane Co. After observing the initial installation, I was surprised to find that customers were using the kiosk for many reasons. They used it when staff was busy. They used it out of pure curiosity. Customers were browsing our product and learning about our company instead of getting on their phone and getting distracted through social media and possibly even browsing competitors sites.</p>
						<h2>Documents</h2>

						<p>This section includes initial sitemaps and wireframes that were changed over time. The kiosk was originally going to be a 55" horizontal touchscreen. I went to look at examples of touchscreens this size and realized this would be way too big and intruisive to the flow of the showrooms.</p>

					<h1>Final Product Overview</h1>
					<p>The Interactive Kiosk is connected to an Adobe Date Feed that allows it to automatically pull images and data from Adobe Scene 7. This produces the catalog page that you see in the rotation. I was even able to use nice full resolution images without bogging down the bandwidth in the stores by pulling key data elements like small images and large images for the full pages.</p>
					<p>You can also see Shane Co.’s social pages such as Instagram, Pinterest, and the blog. This was inspired by the concept that when a man comes in to buy a ring he is at a complete lost as to where to start. They usually pull up her social page for inspiration. Unfortunately, logging into private social accounts would be a major security risk but I was able to provide a data feed of the company’s social pages so that they would be available for reference and inspiration.</p>
					<p>Also included in the kiosk, are company history, the 4c’s, the company’s PR, and date night inspiration. This was to allow the customer to gain some knowledge and insight into the culture and care the company provides for the customer and their employees.</p>

					<h1>Vendors</h1>
					<p>My vendors helped me from start to finish. Without them there would be no kiosk. BOYD signage systems helped build the frame for the kiosk. Four Winds Interactive developed the kiosk. Netsic helped with the installation. I oversaw every step and appreciated the expertise of these companies.</p>
